              <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>
                  Spring Quarter 2020, I was a Design Intern through the Academic Internship Program (AIP) at UC San Diego. It was my second quarter working for the Crack Shack, a gourmet chicken restaurant based in Little Italy in Downtown San Diego. During the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, I had no choice but to work remotely under the guidance of my supervisor, Nicole Rogers, and was able to make the best out of the experience despite the circumstance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  For this final project submission, I wanted to practice my HTML and CSS skills, so I coded this webpage as an extension of my incomplete portfolio.
                </p>
          
            <h3>Tackling the COVID-19 Crisis</h3>
              <p>
                I took on this internship as a 2 unit course, meaning I cut my hours down to half of last quarter's. I was able to accomplish two of my learning objectives, whereas one had to be put aside to focus on more pressing issues. Though the internship was during a global pandemic and we had to change gears, I still got the experience adapting to changes beyond the control of a company.

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>
                Due to the pandemic, there were a lot of changes that had to be made in a short time frame and the comapny had to prioritze wht needed to be done. I helped more on the marketing side of the spectrum by doing research on topics such as contactless pay options and getting things figured out over.

            <h3>Masked Chickens</h3>
              <p>
                Since the Crack Shack's advertising is modern and humorous, one of my tasks was to photoshop masks onto marketing images used in the restaurants. The images were real life chickens on iconic photos such as the Beatles' Abbey Road album cover. I gave each of the chicken heads a mask and the photos were shared on social media platforms.

              Since there were more relevant higlights to display on their Instagram page, I took on the task of creating new icons that were relevant to the pandemic. Since the previous icons were one of my first tasks last quarter, it was obvious that they were not as on brand as they could have been. With more experience at the Crack Shack I had a better grasp of how the icons were supposed to look like and they were more on brand this time around.

              As restrictions started lifting, the Crack Shack restaurants had to plan for reopening. Though restrictions were lifting, there would still need to be social distancing and compliance with the CDC guidelines. To tackle that issue, signs with QR codes were implemented.

There is a QR code at each table that links to the same ordering platform and one must enter thair table number so the servers know where to bring the food.
